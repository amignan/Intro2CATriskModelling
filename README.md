## CAT Starter Kit v1.0

A basic template to develop a catastrophe (CAT) risk model (here with ad-hoc parameters & models). Available in both R (`CAT_StarterKit.R`) and Python (`CAT_StarterKit.py`).


## CAT Risk Modelling Sandbox v1.0

This tutorial acts as a guide to catastrophe (CAT) risk modelling, streamlining the intricate processes typically associated with developing a CAT model while retaining a realistic context. This is achieved by implementing various perils in a virtual environment, as represented in the next figure (Mignan, 2025:fig. 3.10):

All code is available in `CATRiskModellingSandbox_codes.py`. Learn more by running the tutorial `CATRiskModellingSandbox_tutorial.ipynb`. Please note that the code is for educational purposes only, with models kept as simple as possible for ease of understanding.
